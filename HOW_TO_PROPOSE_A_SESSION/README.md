# Proposing Sessions

To propose a session, follow these instructions.

## Step 1: Identify Objectives and Key People

In order to plan a great session, you need to be clear about two things:
1. What are the objectives of the session? What do you want to accomplish with that time?
2. Who needs to participate? Are there key people who need to be present in order for you to achieve the session's objectives?

## Step 2: Pick a Format

You can propose any session format that you think will work for achieving your objectives. We are providing some pre-configured session formats that you can re-use. If you want to propose a session using one of these formats, follow the instructions on the page that describes the format.

- [Project Update Lightning Talks](./lightning-talks): Rapid-fire information-dense project updates
- [Deep Dive](./deep-dive): Deep technical design sessions
- [Poster Making](./poster-making): Work in small groups to create posters and other documentation, then give a one-minute presentation of your work.
- [Hack Time](./hack-time): In pairs, tackle work units explicitly focused on code. Aim for lots of pair programming.
- ... or **specify your own format!** if you want to propose your own session format, follow the instructions in the next few steps.

## Step 3: Create a file using the template

In a branch or fork of this repository (or through github's web interface):

1. Create a new file in [/sessions](./) folder of this repository.
2. Paste the contents of [template.md](./_template.md) into the file.

## Step 4: Write your Session Proposal

Fill in the fields in the template. You can use [this example proposal](./_example.md) as a reference.

- **Title:**  On the first line, provide a title for your session using the format `# Session: Your-Session-Title`
- **Description and Objective:** Describe the session and the motivation for having a session on that topic.
- **Activity:** Describe the activity/format of the session.
- **Outcomes:** List the outputs that will come from the session.
- **Duration:** Specify whether the session will be 30, 60 or 90 minutes
- **Participation:** Declare who should participate in this session, especially anyone who MUST be in that session in order for it to be successful.
- **Agenda:** Outline the agenda for your session, spelling out how you will use the time.

## Step 5: Submit the pull request

When your proposal is ready to submit, create a new PR on this repository. Put your session title in the title of the PR.
