# Poster-Making and Poster Viewing 

_Have fun working in small groups to create posters and other documentation, then give a one-minute presentation of your work._

**Proposed by** @diasdavid  
**Led by** @diasdavid & ???   
**Duration** 60 minutes  
**Who Should Attend:** Anyone who wants to make a poster  
**Who has to be there in order for it to work:** Anyone who wants to either share knowledge or do a bit of research and put findings in a poster.

## Overview

- **Objective**: Promote collaboration, knowledge transfer through deep dives and generation of materials that can be used by others in the future.
- **Activity**: These sessions consist on gathering people into small groups (2~3) and explore and understand in depth one of the selected topics before hand. At the end of the session, everyone should have a poster ready (this will be fun!) and present it to the rest of the group.
- **Outcome**: The posters and discussions will then be converted into docs and/or specs to the IPFS repos.

## Details

We should do this multiple times during the meeting, with multiple small groups working in parallel.

These topics will be pre selected (pre proposed) and they should be things that people keep asking for better explanations or simply are things that are "complex" and we need to document better. Think things like:

- What is Unixfs, how does it work, what are its data structures and what are the shortcomings that lead into the research of UnixfsV2?
- How does Bitswap work?
- What is the connection flow of a libp2p connection? What happens internally and why?
- How does the DHT of IPFS work?
- How does SECIO work?
- IPNS
- Rendezvous Protocol 
- etc
