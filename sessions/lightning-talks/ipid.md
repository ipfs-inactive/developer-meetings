# Session: Interplanetary Identifiers (IPID) a Decentralized Identifiers (DID) Method Spec build on IPFS and Libp2p

- **Proposed by:** @jonnycrunch 
- **Led by:** @jonnycrunch   
- **Duration:** 30 minutes
- **Who Should Attend:** go-ipfs, crypto lead, keystore 
- **Who has to be there in order for it to work:** I would really like some feedback from @stebalien @whyrusleeping

## Overview

- **Objective:** introduce the DID method specs and how IPFS can be strategized to provide truly self-soveriegn identites. 
- **Activity:** Lightning talk 
- **Outcome:** feedback of this approach, should this be implemented in core?, any potential pitfalls?, ideas on Libp2p endpoints, how to best use proof of existence contractss, is IPNS fixed? 


## Details

- [more info ](https://www.github.com/jonnycrunch/ipid)
- General overview of the DID spec and DID methods
- Overview of Decentralized vs Distributed Public Key infrastructure
- Introduce my simple approach to DHT resolving of DID to DID document stored on IPFS as IPLD object stored on IPNS
- Describe DID service endpoints using Libp2p including DID authentication using ECC
- Need feedback on this approach and potential pitfalls
- Should this be stand alone or be included in core?
