# Small Team Working Sessions
_Work together in small groups._

This is a variant on the [poster-making sessions](poster-making-sessions.md) @diasdavid proposed. Rather than having people document something in a poster, let them work together in small teams to tackle a work package using techniques like pair programming.

[Original proposal and discussion at ipfs/conf#43](https://github.com/ipfs/conf/issues/43). 

**Proposed by** @flyingzumwalt & @diasdavid  
**Led by** @diasdavid & ???   
**Duration** 60 minutes (or 90 minutes?) 
**Who Should Attend:** Anyone who wants to work on a work package with a small group  
**Who has to be there in order for it to work:** Many of the work packages involve knowledge from the maintainer who has worked on it the most. We will have to do some advance planning to match people with work packages in a way that will work. 

## Overview

- **Objective**: Tackle known issues that will benefit from people doing synchronous work on them.  
- **Activity**: In pairs or trios, spend 75 minutes unpacking a work package together, designing solutions, pair programming, etc, then report back on the work you accomplished. 
- **Outcomes**: Make progress on important work packages and build people's working relationships.

## Details

Todo: start the list of work packages people could select from

Note: Ideally these teams should be formed before everyone arrives in Berlin.
