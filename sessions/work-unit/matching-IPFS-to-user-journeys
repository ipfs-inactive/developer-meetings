# Matching IPFS to user journeys

**Motivation:** We have started to understand large volume data user needs (via Kelani's user research). We should build on this work by starting to understand how our IPFS development fits into that research so that we can identify areas we're meeting user needs, and areas we might have gaps.

**Activity:** Michelle Hertzfeld (@meiqimichelle) will prepare large-scale (to be posted on a long wall, or several smaller walls), step-by-step visualizations of one or more IPFS user journeys. The end user's goals and experience will form one 'swimlane' across the wall (drawn based on Kelani's recent research report and consultation with PL team members who previously worked in related user roles); a first draft of how IPFS fits into these journeys will form another swimlane below.

Participants are given sticky notes and asked to confirm the accuracy of what they see, editing and adjusting via stickies as needed.* We may also do a secondary dot-voting exercise where participants are asked to identify areas they see as most risky to product success; most blocked at the moment; most frustrating; see the most potential; etc. (exact ask TBD).

**Goal(s):**

- Clear, visual representation of how IPFS development efforts relate to end user journeys
- Clear, visual indication of where IPFS has excellent coverage of user needs, and where IPFS might have critical gaps that would prevent broad adoption
- Identification of areas of the user journey that are well understood, versus areas that are less understand
- Create baseline for future user research

**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Participation:** I've done this exercise with anywhere from a 10 people to over 40. I just need to know ahead of time how many people to expect so I can structure accordingly. As for the topic, connecting feature work into a big picture is never a bad thing for anyone, and it is especially crutial for team leads and other people who choose how to prioritize feature work. I'd want to have a representative from all IPFS areas so that all our work is represented. If a sub-set participates in the excerise, it would be great to then add time later to present to the rest of the team, and provide a different (perhaps async) way for a larger group to provide feedback.

*Why not write directly on the posters, you ask? Because depending on the posters, and the wall, this results in people accidentally using sharpies on venue walls! Eeep.
