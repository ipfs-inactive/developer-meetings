## ⚡️ Lighting Talks

## Videos

The recordings will be uploaded Soon™

## Overview

- **Objective**: Allow many projects to disseminate information across the entire set of attendees.
- **Activity**: In a lecture format, allow a group of people to give pre-prepared 5-minute updates on their projects.
- **Outcome**: Recordings of all the project updates and shared context for conference attendees to operate from.

## Format

Short project updates in rapid succession. No more than 30-45 minutes at a time (6-9 updates). This can/should be done more than once at the meetings to give at least 12-18 projects exposure.

**Duration** 30-45 minutes
**Who Should Attend:** Everyone
**Who has to be there in order for it to work:** People who want to give a project update.
