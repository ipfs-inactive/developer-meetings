## What?

Create a drop-in JS library that enables developers to integrate the `js-ipfs` node into their app.

## Problems

* Multiple IPFS nodes may be running at the same time in the same browser
* Devs can only register one service worker per origin/scope.

## Motivation

Running an IPFS node is an expensive task. Accordingly, when web applications intend to use them in their context, a solution consists on running the node in a service worker, in order to decrease the resources being consumed in the main thread. However, multiple apps would be running their own node. 

A single browser must be running a single IPFS node. This way, web apps should be able to use a node running in a global domain (eg. `js.ipfs.io`). In addition, this node should be accessible by the applications through post-msg. 

As several applications will be interested in the same features such as a gateway resolver, a set of middlewares should be available. Moreover, apps must be able to have their specific logic for hijacking the HTTP requests.

## Solution proposal

**Global Service Worker**

```

 |______________________________|

Domain: js.ipfs.io
Version: js.ipfs.io/v0 (the sw must be versioned)
Task: Run a simple IPFS node
```

**Usage**

1. Main thread usage

const createIframe = require('ipfs-service-worker');

const ipfs = createIframe();

// ipfs is an instance of the ipfs-postmsg-proxy
// https://github.com/tableflip/ipfs-postmsg-proxy
```

2. Service Worker usage (IPFS Node in another SW)

```

 |    |________|                          |

 |________________________________________|


const { gatewayResolverÂ } = require('ipfs-sw-gateway-midleware');

const specificDomainLogic =(ev) => {
  // domain specific logic
};

self.addEventListener(gatewayResolver(specificDomainLogic));

// The event listener can receive a chain of middlewares;
// the idea is to have a bunch of them with multiple functionality
// i.e gatewayResolver, downloadStream, etc.
```

3. Download from Gateway

Anchor elements have a `download` property that works on same origins to allow links to force a download prompt (query argument). When tested this also works with service workers.

## Possible Problems

We need to rely on `ipfs-postmsg` and guarantee feature parity.
