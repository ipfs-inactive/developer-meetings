# Hack Time

Form pairs to tackle work packages explicitly focused on code. **Aim for lots of pair programming.**

- **Duration** 90 minutes (take breaks as needed)
- **Who Should Attend:** Anyone who wants to work on code with a partner
- **Who has to be there in order for it to work:** Many of the work packages involve knowledge from the maintainer who has worked on it the most. The tech leads will circulate around the various groups to answer questions and provide guidance.

## Overview

- **Objective:** Build people's working relationships while tackling known issues that will benefit from people doing synchronous work on them.
- **Activity:** In pairs, spend 90 minutes unpacking a work package together, designing solutions, pair programming, etc, then report back on the work you accomplished. _Especially focus on coding during these sessions._
- **Outcomes:** Commit improvements & fixes and review or merge outstanding PRs related to important work packages.

# Proposed Hack Time Work Packages

**Instructions**
- **If you want to propose something to hack on**, add it here (via a Pull Request). Optionally use the [template](../_template.md) to provide a fuller description of the session.
- **At the start of Hack Time** everyone will choose work packages using post-it notes:
    - All of the work packages will be listed on pieces of paper on a wall. _If you want to add a work package, write it clearly on a piece of paper._ Include your name to show who proposed it in case there are questions.
    - Each person gets one post-it note, puts their name on it, and attaches it to a work package.
    - _You must work in pairs._ If there are already two people on the work package, you need to choose another one or negotiate swapping with someone else in the group.

Some examples:

| Objective | Proposed by | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Dependency Injection for js-libp2p |	@diasdavid | Enable any module to use any other module (currently not easy) |
| Logs & Errors standardization and implementation for IPFS	| @diasdavid	| Make it easy to monitor and debug what is happening |
| Try the metamask network visualization with latest js-libp2p	| @diasdavid	| |
| Logs & Errors standardization and implementation for IPFS	| @diasdavid | Make it easy to monitor and debug what is happening

| Revive ipget	| @diasdavid	| ipget is dead, long live ipget! |
| Revamp ipscend	| @diasdavid	|  |
| Make catReadableStream work with arbitrary chunked objects| @parkan | urlstore objects are not compatible with ReadableStream, even though they're of almost the right shape |
