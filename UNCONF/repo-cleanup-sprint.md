# Repo Cleanup Sprint

**Description:** There are several issues where we’ve worked out some concrete ways we can improve the understandability and organization of the plethora of repos we have on GitHub, but we have failed to actually execute on them for each repo. Let’s have project owners (who have the rights to make changes to the description of a repo or archive a repo) sit down and just *do that work.* Since folks will be sitting down and working together, it gives everyone a good opportunity to quickly gut-check each other on things like whether a description is good or it makes sense to archive a repo.

- [Develop a standard way to indicate a repo/project is deprecated (ipfs/docs#54)](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/issues/54)
- [Make sure every repo has a description and readme (ipfs/docs#55)](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/issues/55)
- [Develop a standard way to indicate non-code repos (ipfs/docs#57)](https://github.com/ipfs/docs/issues/57)
- Make sure repos adhere to the [licensing policy](https://github.com/ipfs/community/blob/68f2fc02c4384eeb765ebc7547ea07f3aa2268c1/docs/licensing-policy.md), now that we have one :)

**Activity:** Work sprint.

**Goal(s):**

At the end of this session, most repos listed in the above issues should be clearly indicated as deprecated (if they should be), should have clear descriptions and readmes, and should have GitHub topics.

**Duration:** 30 minutes

**Participation:** People with access to change the description or to archive repos that are listed in the above issues.
