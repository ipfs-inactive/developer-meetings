# Defining IPFS Concepts

In ipfs/docs#56, we’ve laid out a long list of IPFS-related concepts that many users might be unfamiliar with — both things that are components of IPFS, like *bitswap,* and things that are more general, like *DAG.* In this session, we’ll start with a series of strawman definitions and choose several that we are least happy with and that are most important to create better descriptions of. The results can be used to seed the concepts section of the new docs site.

If [the effort to do this for IPLD](https://github.com/ipld/ipld/issues/39) is any indication, having a synchronous time to discuss and work these out could be really valuable.

**Activity:** Rob Brackett (@Mr0grog) will prepare sheets with rough descriptions of a bunch of concepts from ipfs/docs#56. We'll start the session by having them on a wall and giving participants dots or post-its to vot for the ones they feel need the most attention — whether because the definitions are wildly inaccurate or because they are particularly important to someone. (Note: we could maybe post these up near the start of the summit and give people lots of time to vote on them before the session.)

Then we’ll take the most voted on ones (how many will depend on how many participants we have) and break into groups to work on them, returning with a poster that they present to everyone at the end.

**Goal(s):**

Clear, understandable, non-expert descriptions of several IPFS concepts that we can use to start to fill in the docs site.

**Duration:** 60 minutes

**Participation:** This needs *at least* 6 people to make it work, and at least a couple of those people should be core maintainers of an IPFS project. It will be valuable to have participants from both outside and inside PL.
